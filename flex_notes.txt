The minimal scanner is just a file with '%' character in it. But it requires linking with flex lib.
To avoid that, our simplest scanner (F0.l) contains user code section and the second '%' required in such case.

Any indented text or text enclosed in "%{" and "%}" in the definitions secion is copied verbatim to the output. 
The "%{" and "%}" must appear unindented on lines by themselves.

In the rules section, any indented text or text inside "%{" "%}" included before the first rule may be used 
to declare variables which are local to the scanning routine and (after the declarations) code which is to 
be executed whenever the scanning routine is entered. 

In the definitions section (but not in the rules section), an unindented comment 
(i.e., a line beginning with "/*") is also copied verbatim to the output up to the next "*/".
